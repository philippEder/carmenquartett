# CarmenQuartett â€” Angular scaffold

This is a lightweight Angular application scaffold for the CarmenQuartett website.
It uses a simple responsive layout inspired by the design and layout of the reference site.

## How to run locally

1. Install Node.js (16+ recommended) and npm.
2. From the project root (where package.json is), run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npx ng serve --open
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run start
   ```

3. The app will open at http://localhost:4200

## Notes & next steps

- Replace placeholder assets in `src/assets` (images, audio).
- Hook the contact form to your email backend or a service like Formspree.
- Consider adding proper icons, fonts, and analytics as needed.

This scaffold is intentionally minimal so you can customize it freely.
